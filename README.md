## Write short or long-form content with the end goal of simplifying your brand message. Ready to give it a go?
With 8+ years of writing experience under my belt, I can juggle both **content writing & copywriting**. I love craftive engaging and informative pieces.

Working with many editors and content managers, and collaborating with tech start-ups throughout the years, I found that being part of a team is just as fun as writing on my own.

### My üéØ Writing Experience
- collaborated with: **Digital Tailors** | **Softbinator** | **Code Truck** | **3DLOOK** | **CyberGhost** | **Altrady** | **BWARE LABS** | **studyportals** | **e-student.org**
