## Write short or long-form content with the end goal of simplifying your brand message. Ready to give it a go?
With 8+ years of writing experience under my belt, I can juggle both **content writing & copywriting**. I love crafting engaging and informative pieces.

Working with many editors and content managers, and collaborating with tech start-ups throughout the years, I found that being part of a team is just as fun as writing on my own.
